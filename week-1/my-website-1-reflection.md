- Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
  - Go to github.com and open an account if you haven't already.
  - Click the "+" at the top right of the page and select "new repository"
  - Fill out the new repo form. Congrats! You now have a new repository, which is like a master folder for your project.
  - In your new repository, copy the clone url on the right side of your page.
  - Enter your command line (the program "terminal" on mac will do) and (assuming everything is set up) type "git clone (url)" replacing "(url)" with the url you copied.
  - You did it!

- Describe what open source means.

Open source refers to code that is public and can be downloaded, modified, re-published and distributed, for no fee. Truly open source code can be manipulated however a user likes, but there are often liscenses that restrict commercialization or require attribution.

- What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

For the most part it's awesome and seems like an incredible way to work cooperatively, so sort of utopian in that way. But I would be nervous if not for liscenses - I mean, I hope I would AT LEAST get attribution for my work.

- Assess the importance of using licenses.

Liscenses do all sorts of important things. They can require attribution to the original author, restrict re-selling of the program, or limit what can be changed (if anything). Liscenses are a way to make sure you don't get screwed and that, if you are making your code somewhat open source, you can control exactly what people can do to it.

- What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

Well I took a basic web design course in college where we learned some html and css, so the html portion was super easy. But what clicked for me was exactly how you use git and github to work on a project like a website, and also why it's smart and efficient to do so. Up to this point the practical uses of git and github were a bit nebulous.

- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Nope! But I did go back to previous lessons and use my notes, and the articles linked in the lesson were very helpful.
