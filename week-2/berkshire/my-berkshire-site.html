<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
Working together on html raised some questions and practical concerns about collaboration in git and github. Floating repositories with the same names confused us a bit and we discuss it before moving forward. There was also a lot of trial and error testing.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
We didn't have to research too much, but when we did it was pretty easy to find answers just using google and w3.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
We stuck to leaving out formatting - it's pretty easy not to do something, but we both know this isn't what a finished site looks like.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
HTML is straightforward and intuitive, which is great. But formatting is tricky to get just right, and it's pretty bare bones.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
Certainly sublime helps with filling in and recommending tags. Other than that, just good old fashion human memory!
