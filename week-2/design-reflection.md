- What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

The 6 phases of web design are:

1. Information Gathering
2. Planning
3. Design
4. Development
5. Testing and Delivery
6. Maintenance  

- What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

My site's primary goal is to showcase me and my projects to prospective employers. I'll also use it as a portfolio for the web design that I will eventually do for some actors in my network. My site will have my contact, portfolios of projects and web design, an "about me" section, and a link to my blog.

- What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My target audience will want to see my credentials, so I'll put them at the forefront. They'll be on the front page and in my "about me" section, and my contact and projects will be easily available in the nav bar. I'll use a drop down menu in the projects section!

- What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's okay to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

The primary action should be obtaining info about me and hopefully contacting me.

- What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

Someone should probably know that design and UX should be implemented with the user in mind, rather than the designer's taste or the client's perspective - of course, it's important to get the client thinking that way. 

Information gathering is an important step in the design process because it will inform the entire project. The categories laid out in Selene Bowlby's article - purpose, goals, target audience, and content - are a useful way to approach information gathering from a standpoint that is efficient, utilitarian, and human.

Planning is very important to keep your design project tidy, timely, and organized. And actual designing (by hand) is important to maintaining a consistent vision and achieving the desired result.

Some important UX principles are logical and intuitive site maps, dynamic scaling and different versions that look good for different kinds of users, and of course, the importance of planning.

- What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

User experience design, or UX design, is the art of evaluating and designing web sites and web applications to satisfy the site's users. It aims to enhance the usability, enjoyability, and general ease of the site or app.

- Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

Every step was a little tedious - I feet like I know where all of the info is located, it seemed like I was going over a lot of redundant data, and the site map was fairly simple and obvious. But I understand that this is all pretty vital and are a few good planning practices.
