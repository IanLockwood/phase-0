- What is a wireframe?

A wireframe is a simple visual rendering of what you'd like your website to look like. It's just like the blueprint for a house or the outline of an illustration.

- What are the benefits of wireframing?

Wireframing is an important tool for planning your site before coding it. Rather than code and design at the same time, a wireframe serves as a guide for your code.

- Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

I did! It was fun and creative. That said, if I were pressed for time, I'd probably find it tedious and a little frustrating.

- Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

I revised it a little, and I changed my site map a bit to make the wireframing look better. It was useful to see the basic idea on paper (or screen) and then fix the little problems I hadn't considered.

- What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

Mostly just which wireframing tool to use and if there were any good free ones to use. I found one I liked in the mashable list that was linked in the assignment, but I've yet to find a great free tool.

- Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

I actually enjoyed all of it, but like I said, in a time crunch I would have been frustrated. I would have gotten less fancy and found precise spacing tedious.
