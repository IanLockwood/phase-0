# Concatenate Two Arrays

# I worked on this challenge by myself.


# Your Solution Below

=begin

def array_concat(array_1, array_2)
	array_1 + array_2
end

This is really the most concise way to do this. But here's the built in method:
=end

def array_concat(array_1, array_2)
	array_1.concat(array_2)
end
