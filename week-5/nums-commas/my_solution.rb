# What is the input?
# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?

# Take in integer
# IF it is < 1000
# RETURN the integer
# ELSE Convert the integer to a string with to_s
# Use the INSERT method and iterate to insert commas in the -4, -8, -12, etc. position.
# return the string

def separate_comma(num)
	if num < 1000
		return num.to_s
	end
