# Numbers to Commas Solo Challenge

# I spent [] hours on this challenge.

# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.

# 0. Pseudocode

# What is the input?
# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?

# Take in integer
# IF it is >= 1000
# Convert the integer to a string with to_s
# REVERSE the string
# Create a new variable and 


# return the string
# ELSE
# RETURN the integer


# 1. Initial Solution

def separate_comma(num)

end

# def separate_comma(num)
# 	i = 0
# 	if num < 1000
# 		return num.to_s
# 	else
# 		to_return = ""
# 		num.to_s.split(//).each do |x|
# 		i += 1
# 		to_return += x
# 		to_return += "," if (i % 3 = 0)
# 	end
# 		return to_return.reverse
# 	end
# end
